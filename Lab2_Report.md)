# Lab 2: Implementation of Network Topologies

## Objective
To implement and understand different network topologies.

## Materials Required
- Packet Tracer software

## Theory
### Overview of Various Network Topologies
1. **Bus Topology**
   - All devices are connected to a single central cable, known as the bus.
   - **Advantages**: Simple to set up and cost-effective for small networks.
   - **Disadvantages**: Limited cable length; if the bus fails, the entire network goes down.

2. **Star Topology**
   - All devices are connected to a central hub or switch.
   - **Advantages**: Easy to install and manage; failure of one device does not affect others.
   - **Disadvantages**: If the central hub fails, the entire network is affected.

3. **Ring Topology**
   - Devices are connected in a circular format, where each device is connected to two others.
   - **Advantages**: Predictable performance; easy to add devices.
   - **Disadvantages**: A failure in any device or connection can disrupt the entire network.

4. **Mesh Topology**
   - Devices are interconnected, with multiple paths between any two devices.
   - **Advantages**: High redundancy and reliability.
   - **Disadvantages**: Complex to install and manage; requires a lot of cabling.

5. **Hybrid Topology**
   - A combination of two or more different topologies.
   - **Advantages**: Flexible and scalable.
   - **Disadvantages**: Can be complicated to design and manage.

## Procedure
1. **Open Packet Tracer**.

2. **Implement a Bus Topology**:
   - Create a simple network with three devices connected to a single cable.
   - **Test**: Use the ping command between devices to confirm connectivity.

3. **Implement a Star Topology**:
   - Connect three devices to a central switch using straight-through cables.
   - **Test**: Ping between devices to ensure successful communication.

4. **Implement a Ring Topology**:
   - Arrange three devices in a circular pattern, connecting each device to its neighbors.
   - **Test**: Verify connectivity by pinging each device from others.

5. **Implement a Mesh Topology**:
   - Connect four devices to each other, ensuring each device has a direct connection to every other device.
   - **Test**: Perform ping tests to check connectivity across all devices.

## Observations
- **Bus Topology**: All devices communicated successfully.
- **Star Topology**: All devices communicated successfully through the central switch.
- **Ring Topology**: Successful communication was verified between all devices.
- **Mesh Topology**: All devices were able to communicate without issues.

## Conclusion
Each topology has distinct characteristics and applications:
- **Bus Topology** is easy and cost-effective for small networks but has a single point of failure.
- **Star Topology** is robust but depends on the central hub.
- **Ring Topology** offers predictable performance but is sensitive to disruptions.
- **Mesh Topology** provides redundancy but is complex to manage.
- **Hybrid Topology** combines various features but can complicate design.

Understanding these topologies is crucial for designing efficient and reliable networks tailored to specific needs.
